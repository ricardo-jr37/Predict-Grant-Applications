# Predict-Grant-Applications
Around the world, the pool of funds available for research grants is steadily shrinking (in a relative sense). In Australia, success rates have fallen to 20-25 per cent, meaning that most academics are spending valuable time making applications that end up being rejected.

With this problem in mind, the University of Melbourne is hosting a competition to predict the success of grant applications. The winning model will be used by the university to predict which grant applications are likely to be successful, so that less time is wasted on applications that are unlikely to succeed. The university hopes the competition will also shed some light on what factors are important in determining whether an application will succeed.

The university has provided a dataset containing 249 features, including variables that represent the size of the grant, the general area of study and de-identified information on the investigators who are applying for the grant. Participants train their models on 8,707 grant applications made between 2004 and 2008. They then make predictions on a further 2,176 applications made in 2009 and the first half of 2010.
